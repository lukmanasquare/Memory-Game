This project involves developing an interactive Memory Game web application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of the game is to challenge users to test their memory skills by flipping over pairs of cards to find matching images. Players can turn over two cards at a time, and if the cards match, they remain revealed; otherwise, they are flipped back. The game continues until all pairs are successfully matched. This project demonstrates the use of front-end web technologies, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming to create an engaging and visually appealing user experience.
